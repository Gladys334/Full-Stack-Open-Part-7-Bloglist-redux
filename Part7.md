# Full Stack Open Part 7 – Bloglist App with Redux

I completed all exercises **7.9–7.21** on my Connex Serenity Tablet (Android 1055).  
This part continues the Bloglist app from Part 6 using **Redux**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **React Router**.

---

## 7.9–7.13: Redux Basics
I added Redux to the Bloglist app.  
Created a Redux slice to manage blogs and notifications.

---

## 7.14–7.16: Users and Blog Views
I added a Users page that shows all users and how many blogs each has created.  
Each user has their own page that lists their blogs.  
Each blog also has its own detailed page with likes and other information.

---

## 7.17: Navigation
I added a navigation menu at the top of the app.  
It has links for **blogs**, **users**, and **logout** so it’s easy to move between pages.

---

## 7.18–7.19: Comments
I added a comment section for each blog post.  
Users can see and add comments.  
Comments are saved to the backend and shown under each blog.

---

## 7.20–7.21: Styles
I improved the look of the app using CSS.  
I made the layout cleaner and spent time improving the design.  
Finished styling and pushed all changes to GitHub.
