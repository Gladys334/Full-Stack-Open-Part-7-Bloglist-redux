# Full Stack Open Part 7.16 – Blog View

I finished exercise 7.16.  
I added a separate page for each blog post.  
Users can click a blog title to open its own view and see details such as the author, likes, and link.  
This continues from my Part 7 bloglist app.  
Done on my Connex Serenity Tablet.
